# Unit Converter  Scrimba FrontEnd Module 3 - Essential Javascript Concepts 

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
````


See 

```[Demo](https://shahs-unit-converter.netlify.app/)
```

## Functionality
- First select if you want your passwords to include numbers, letters or symbols using the checkboxes
- On submission, random passwords will be rendered. This is achieved through indexing the selected array . 
- You can copy the generated password 

##Frameworks/Libraries/Apis/Techniques used
- Map function 
- Object Destructuring 
- ClassList.toggle

## Stretch goals
- I have incorporated dark mode, i think one of my only projects that doesn't use React to do so.
- The challenge was to originally use for loops, i could use for of or for each, but neither of these can return information and would instead rely on template literal concatenation. 
- I could add a copy function
  
## Further Stretch Goals/General Improvements
- I would like to break my CSS into typography to make maintenance easier from a responsive design point of view
- I could refactor the event listeners into a single event listener
- I could recode the application using React but do not wish to as the functionality of this app is rather basic
